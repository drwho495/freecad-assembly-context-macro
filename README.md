# Assembly Context Creator

This is a 'Assembly Context Creator' for FreeCAD. It should work in assembly 3,4 and the default workbench. 
To use it just select the parent that holds all of your parts. In Assembly 3, select the object named 'Parts'.
In the default workbench, select the object with the 'Assembly' type.

If you are getting a "failed to obtain shape" error after updating an assembly, you will need to close and reopen your active document.
